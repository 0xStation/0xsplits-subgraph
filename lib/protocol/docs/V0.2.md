# Protocol V0.2

Reputation represents positive-sum relationships between humans.
Your reputation should follow the quality and quantity of your relationships.
One should not chase reputation for reputation's sake; one simply seeks to help
others and accruing reputation is a biproduct of this act of giving.

# Design Principles

1. Reputation is a relationship between humans
2. DAOs own their tools and can configure them
3. Opportunity cost surfaces relative value
4. Complex mechanisms rely on simple and rigid components, not complex ones

# Contributor Ticket (CT)

**OVERVIEW** 

* NFT that represents membership in a DAO
* access is gated by DAO's settings and receiving an invitation from an existing member
* contains additional on-chain metadata for badges, roles, etc. that evolve over time
* gates access to the DAO’s Terminal

**DATA**

* [ERC721](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol) (`owners`, `balances`)
* ID for address (reverse lookup of `owners`)
* tags for ID → enumeration of roles, badges, tags held by a specific contributor

**ACTIONS**

* `claim`: mint a new NFT given a signature + endorsement from current contributor
    * enforce only one NFT per address
* `deactivate`: "turn off" NFT’s ability to participate in the network
* `transfer`: move ownership of the NFT to a new address barring DAO approval
* `addTag`: add new tag to specific ID
* `removeTag`: remove tag from specific ID

# Endorsement Token (ET)

**OVERVIEW** 

* FT that represents the ability to endorse someone to raise their influence
* issued programmatically on a schedule defined by the DAO
* potentially burnable for slashing mechanics on unendorsing someone
* potentially transferable for delegation mechanics

**DATA**

* [ERC20](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol) (`balances`, `totalSupply`)
* ERC20Policy (wrapper that applies policy checks before action execution)
* MasterChef math variables

**ACTIONS**

* `issue`: create new tokens and distribute to contributors
* `burn`: destroy existing tokens for penalty incentive mechanisms
* `transfer`: delegate existing tokens to be staked by other contributors

# Endorsement Graph (EG)

**OVERVIEW** 

* a graph where contributors (nodes) stake endorsements (edges) to one another
* edge values are non-transferrable and can be unstaked by initial endorser
* associated with one Endorsement Token as the staking collateral
* associated with one Contributor Ticket as the node identifier
* stores net endorsements staked to and from a given member
* will utilize net endorsements staked for distribution of new ET issuance

**DATA**

* `contributorNFT` → address of implementation
* `endorsementToken` → address of implementation
* edge values between NFT indexes (nodes)
* net edge values directed to an NFT index (node)
* net edge values directed from an NFT index (node)

**ACTIONS**

* `stake`: lock Endorsement Token and increase edge value by equivalent amount
* `unstake`: unlock Endorsement Token and decrease edge value by equivalent amount
    - optionally burn portion on unstaked tokens
